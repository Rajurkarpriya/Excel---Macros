📊 Excel Macros for Data Formatting & Chart Creation
This project demonstrates how to use Excel Macros to automate data formatting and visualization.
I used a dataset containing country-wise revenue and profit for Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3, and automated the process of:
✅ Cleaning & formatting the raw dataset
✅ Applying colors, borders, and bold headings
✅ Creating charts automatically

📹 Project Demo
See how I converted a plain dataset into a clean, colorful, and chart-ready report using Macros!
